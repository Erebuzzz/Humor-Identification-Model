# Create a markdown file for the above

Here is a **markdown file** (`instructions.md`) listing all files you need to download and where to place them for your humor identification project. This will ensure your code runs fully offline and reproducibly.

---

# Instructions for Local File Setup

To run this humor identification project **completely offline and reproducibly**, download and store the following files in your project directory as described below.

---

## 1. Yelp Dataset (Reviews)

- **File Needed:**
`yelp_academic_dataset_review.json`
- **Where to Get:**
[Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
- **Where to Place:**
Place in a folder such as:

```
D:\Humor Detection\yelp_dataset\yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
```

*(Or update the `DATASET_PATH` variable in your code to match your location.)*

---

## 2. GloVe Embeddings

- **File Needed:**
`glove.6B.100d.txt`
- **Where to Get:**
    - [Official Stanford GloVe page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) ([direct link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip))
    - [Zenodo mirror](https://zenodo.org/record/4925376)
- **How to Prepare:**

1. Download and unzip `glove.6B.zip`.
2. Copy only `glove.6B.100d.txt` (about 350 MB) to your project folder.
- **Where to Place:**

```
C:\Users\kshit\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Humor-Identification-Model\glove.6B.100d.txt
```

*(Or update the `GLOVE_PATH` variable in your code.)*

---

## 3. BERT Model Files (bert-base-uncased, Local)

- **Folder Needed:**
`bert-base-uncased` (containing all model files)
- **Where to Get:**
    - [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)
- **How to Download:**

1. Download these files from the model page:
        - `config.json`
        - `pytorch_model.bin`
        - `tokenizer.json`
        - `tokenizer_config.json`
        - `vocab.txt`
        - (Optional: `special_tokens_map.json`)
2. Place all files in a folder named `bert-base-uncased`.
- **Where to Place:**

```
C:\Users\kshit\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Humor-Identification-Model\bert-base-uncased\
```

*(This should match the `BERT_LOCAL_PATH` in your code.)*
- **Tip:**
If you have issues downloading via browser, you can use `git-lfs`:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased
```


---

## 4. Python Dependencies

- **Install these packages in your virtual environment:**

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn tqdm networkx nltk gensim torch transformers
```


---

## 5. (Optional) Example Output/Exported Files

- **Zagreb Indices Export:**
The script will create `zagreb_indices_results.txt` in your project folder after running.

---
